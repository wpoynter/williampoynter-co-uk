CLOSER’s flagship product is Discovery, a DDI-backed search engine for the documentation and appraisal for the eight consortium studies. To enhance the searchability of Discovery all Variables and QuestionConstructs in Discovery require a Topic from CLOSER&amp;rsquo;s controlled vocabulary. Archivist provides bespoke infrastructure for inputting topic allocations. Through the use of Strands and Clusters the work has been reduced by 75%.</description></item><item><title>CLOSER Repository: Modernising Longitudinal Study Management</title><link>https://www.williampoynter.co.uk/publications/modernisinglongitudinalstudymanagement/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.williampoynter.co.uk/publications/modernisinglongitudinalstudymanagement/</guid><description>CLOSER Discovery is a cutting edge search engine for the discovery of metadata on eight of the UK’s cohort and longitudinal studies. The longest running study that is documented in CLOSER Discovery has been running for over 70 years, which creates a formidable problem to document and manage. CLOSER Discovery demonstrates the importance of investing in rich metadata that describes many more aspects of data collection than traditional tools and methods.</description></item></channel></rss>
