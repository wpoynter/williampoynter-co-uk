TL;DR: Their claims of being substantially faster than their competitors and being able to just drop Bun in to replace incumbents such as Jest, are true. From being able to execute TypeScript directly, no longer worrying about the separation of ESM and CommonJS and being far more plug-n-play than Jest, Bun won me over very quickly.
